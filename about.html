                         <h4><p>My name is Yazmyn and I made this website when I was a sophmore in high school. I love to code so I took a web design class to learn more about it
                             and that is where i created this site as a project for that class. I choose to make my website about college addmission because many students don't 
                             take advantage of the oppurtunities they are given. I have made it easier for students to take advantage of al these oppurtunities and all they have
                             to do is look for the options that match your educational path.
